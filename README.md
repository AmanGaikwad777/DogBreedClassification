# DogBreedClassification
This project tackles the challenge of fine-grained image classification by identifying 120 dog breeds from the ImageNet canine subset. Using deep learning techniques, the model learns to distinguish between visually similar breeds, such as Norfolk and Norwich Terriers, aiming for accurate and robust breed identification.
